      description: `Introducing Alfie! Alfie is an independent little guy looking for a home of his own. Alfie absolutely loves to go on quiet walks where he can sniff and explore. Alfie does get worried in new situations and with new people, so he is looking for a calm, adult-only home. He enjoys the company of other small dogs and they help him feel more comfortable, so he will need to go to a home with a small dog. If you’re a patient person who enjoys walks with your dog, Alfie could be the perfect addition to your life. Come meet him today! Bring your dog along to see if they hit it off. A behavior consult is included prior to Alfie’s adoption.␊
      The adoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip ID, collar and OHS I.D. tag, initial vaccines, courtesy veterinarian exam, 30 days free PetPlan health insurance for Oregon Residents and plenty of post adoption support!`,
